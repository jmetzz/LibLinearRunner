2 Classes (549 E,i 585 Sc): Majority error 0.48 2classes
3 Classes (549 E, Sc 585, I 336): Majority error 0.77 3classes



2 classes
    SIFT vs SURF
    #Classifiers (RF, FURIA, MLP_df, MLP_1, MLP_2, LIBSVM, SMO, LIBLINEAR)

For each measure (F1, AUC)

    For each dataset
        a) overall method for each descriptor
            - test all results for SURF
            - test all results for SIFT
        b) overal combination
            - test all results combining SIFT and SURF

            What I need?
                - 1 file with results for 2 classes + SURF
                - 1 file with results for 2 classes + SIFT
                - 1 file with all results for N classes dataset
